# Welcome to the Adyen ECOM starter guide

## Purpose 
The purpose of this repo was to create an easy way for Tech Support Trainers to quickly create realistic scenarios for new starters to practice using our tools. This repo is paired with the training problem document linked here (NEED TO ADD)

## Requirements 
* Code Editor 
* PHP installed on your machine 

## Directions to download 
1. Download this repo on your local machine 
2. Create a New API credential on merchant account PaymentsMadeEasy_NA_Support_Training_TEST in TEST and create an API and Client Key 
3. In the root project folder on your machine, create a .env file and add the variables CHECKOUT_APIKEY, CLIENT_KEY, and MERCHANT_ACCOUNT, filling in the relevant information from Back Office
4. Navigate to the location of the folder in your terminal, type ./start.sh and hit enter.
5. The integration should be running on https://localhost:3000

## How it works 
* Each page has directions on how best to create the scenario in the logs 
* Each scenario is linked to a corresponding problem on the training problem document 
* For best results, check to ensure that you can find the log line before sending it off to the new joiners.
